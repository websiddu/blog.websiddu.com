                <p>Building a design portfolio website can be a daunting task especially when you are just starting with your design career or you are design student with no coding skills. I have heard many question from my classmates asking where do I start. In this post I will try to explain how to build a portfolio website end to end. I will try to cover most of the topics in detail. I divided this post into different parts, in the first part I will explain the purpose of the design portfolio website, in the second part I will give some ideas to design the layout of your website, in the third part we will see different options for building the website and finally different options to deploy your website.</p>

<p>Thought out this blog post I will give my own experiences as example. What I say here are my own opinions and others may have different opinions. So let’s get started,</p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>As we all know the portfolio website is particularly important for a UX related job as the recruiters will get a sense of your work. There is a high success rate for the phone call if you have a portfolio website. These portfolios can talk for you, When I applied for Google my portfolio got 100’s of page view from Mountain View. My point here is people do care about your portfolio when you apply for a job.  So let’s make the portfolio great again.</p>

<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>

<p>As a designer we have to consider everything for designing your portfolio. These considerations are really important not only for designing your portfolio but for any kind of design project. The considerations will give you a great understanding about the problem that you are going to solve. In this case designing your portfolio. So let’s list down some of the considerations that you might want to make for building the design portfolio.</p>

<h4 id="target-users-">Target Users 👱🏻‍</h4>

<p>The target users for your design portfolio is mainly recruiters, design managers and designers. To be practical most of the times you are waiting for that one recruiter phone call from the recruiter. And based on my websites Google Analytics data I did not see any recruiter spending more than 25 seconds on my website. Which includes quickly navigating to couple of portfolio projects and reading your about page. You are mostly targeting recruiters who have less time.  And designers who have design sense and ability to judge a design. Let’s call our recruiter friend as David and design manager as Lynda.</p>

<h4 id="target-devices-">Target devices 📱</h4>

<p>So now you know David and Lynda are going to look at your portfolio at sometime. Now let’s think about where and when are they going to look at your portfolio. David might be using a Windows machine and a Microsoft Edge on a 13” Lenovo machine when reviewing 100’s of the applications he got. In other words, you have to make sure that your site works on most of the modern browsers and OS’s.  Now let’s say that you went to a design even and you are networking with a design manager and you know that she is potentially looking for new blood in her team. You should be able to pull up your website on your mobile phone and impress her. In short, your website need to be responsive and always ready to show off.</p>

<h4 id="typography-">Typography 🔤</h4>

<p>As designer you are expected to have a taste when choosing a font. Please don’t not choose a random font. The the typeface you choose may convey your character sometimes. I believe that the typefaces you choose and the way that you used them may convey a lot of things about you. They will set the mood and they will earn you respect. Be thoughtful about the typefaces and font sizes you choose. I’m pretty sure, Lynda will appreciate your thoughtfulness and will add some extra points than a poorly chosen fonts.</p>

<h4 id="technology-">Technology 💻</h4>

<p>Remember you are going to build your own website. Not everyone have the luxury of  having a girlfriend or boyfriend who can build the site for you. So be careful about choosing the technology. I will explain in detail about the different options that you might want to consider.</p>

<h4 id="content-">Content ✏️</h4>

<p>This is the most important part. The project you choose to show on your portfolio will determine whether you going to get a call or not. Choose the content very carefully. I will give you more detailed explanations in the below sections.</p>

<p>Now you really know what your website is going to be. Write down all the these considerations and make sure that your address them.</p>

<h3 id="design-">Design 🍥</h3>

<p>Let’s jump into designing the website. Don’t just think draw them out on a piece of paper. Its upto your creativity how you structure your website. To begin with I divided the portfolio site into different sub parts,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Logo</li>
  <li>Name &amp; Blurb</li>
  <li>Navigation
    <ol>
      <li>Home</li>
      <li>Resume</li>
      <li>About</li>
      <li>Contact</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Projects List</li>
  <li>Project Details</li>
  <li>Footer
    <ol>
      <li>Social links</li>
      <li>Some other fun stuff</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact
    <ol>
      <li>Contact form</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>95% of the portfolio website will contain the above 8 sections. You may have different designs by rearranging these components.</p>

<p>Here I will give your couple of very simple and effective never fail designs.</p>

<p>Option I</p>

<p><img src="image_0.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>

<p>Option I</p>

<p><img src="image_1.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>

<p>Option II</p>

<p><img src="image_2.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>

<p>I have seen a number of good portfolio website with these two patterns. One particular version that I didn’t cover is a portfolio with a landing page and requires a click to see the list of projects. This is particularly not a good design as David won’t even bother clicking the button. David likes scrolling.</p>

<p>Now you decided on the layout for the landing page let’s move to the project detail pages. If you get the layout correct for the project details page your portfolio will look great. Let’s think about the detail page and jot down all the possible information about your side project or school project that you did.</p>

<p>I refereed multiple good portfolio and listed the most common sections.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Project title</li>
  <li>Brief intro about the project</li>
  <li>Type of project</li>
  <li>Timeline</li>
  <li>The team members</li>
  <li>My role</li>
  <li>Main content
    <ol>
      <li>Introduction
        <ol>
          <li>A video</li>
          <li>Links to resources</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Problem</li>
      <li>Process</li>
      <li>Research</li>
      <li>Prototypes
        <ol>
          <li>Paper prototypes – Pro’s and Cons</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Design
        <ol>
          <li>Images</li>
          <li>Videos</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Outcome</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Next Project</li>
  <li>Previous Project</li>
</ol>

<p>Write down this information for each and every project under the subheadings project project in each google doc.</p>

<p>Once you start writing things your will start remembering each and every small details of your design. Take your time do only a couple of projects on a weekend not more than that. Bring up all the pictures you took with your group, the paper prototypes you made. Just looking at them will refresh your memories.</p>

<p>Once you are confidant what you want to put in each project them we need to layout this information. You can keep tweaking the content once the layout is finalized. You could use the same layout that you created on the Google doc. But we are designers, let’s activate some negative spaces and build a nice layout for our project detail pages.</p>
