                <p>Here are the list of morning thoughts I had from the past few weeks, some might sound stupid but they are really deep you just have to think which we general do less these days.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having balance is the most important thing, both in life and also bank account. Live thoughtful. Spend careful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is like a volleyball, people just keep hitting it constantly only until the game ends, you just gotta be patient to live in peace‚Ä¶ but wait there will be another match coming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change is like eating grapes üçá. You never know when that one sour grape is going spoil your mouth.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowing people is like understanding a piece of art work. The more sophisticated the art/people are the more time you have to spend. Once you know them you may appreciate, enjoy, love them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boeken heart is like a broken glass, even if you try to patch them up it will never be the same. Try not to break hearts.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone does what they want to do, so why bother convincing them what to do or what not to do?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Babies are the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A person makes a joke, it will be humor if u like them or it will be insult if u don‚Äôt like them. It‚Äôs all perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>By chance, a person can be right  for the wrong reasons. Like.. a broken clock can show the right time twice a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judging a person without exploring them is like judging a kimberlite by its looks. There could be a diamond inside.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Personal secrets are generally mistakes you did, that you are ashamed of sharing with others. Try to have less secrets.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accepting the rejection will make you think deep &amp; strong. The more you hammer a nail the deep it goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hope will keep you motivated not to give up. So, let‚Äôs hope even it‚Äôs hard to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do what you are suppose to do, not what you are expected. Bcz expectations are subjective and vary from person to person.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Guessing ones pain is like u watching them eating a ghost chili. U don‚Äôt know the real heat until you expirence it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Self respect is like perfectly cooked salmon. Over cook, it will become ego. Under cook, it will become self-deprecation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good things will happen to good people if not right away sometime in future. So be good. Also known as karma.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only having brightness in life is actually darkness. And then bright will be the new dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saying NO is much better than ignoring a person. One should learn to respect others.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pause before you say I, me, or my &amp; think if you really need to say that. This slowly heals your selfcenteredness problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good ideas are generated by combining two or more perspectives. Be open and listen to what others have to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is nothing called bad luck. There are actions and consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being rigid will create more friction &amp; pain and you will not move forward. Be adaptive like water and move forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before blaming others blame yourself for blaming others and you will never blame others for your mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Value of anything is situational. Water  will be more valuable than gold in a desert. Don‚Äôt underestimate.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>None is superior to none. Personal choices, time, opportunities &amp; situations make us different.Just different not superior.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The way that we think about our needs and want will determine our happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certainty will make your life lazy and boring. Be uncertain and expect the unexpected to make your life more lively.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before you think about the things that you don‚Äôt have, think about the things you have and appreciate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forgiveness is like climbing to the top of a steep mountain. It‚Äôs hard, but once you reach there you are on the TOP.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emotions are like sudden waves in an ocean journey. They will take u in a wrong direction, if you don‚Äôt navigate properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trust is a mysterious concept like a kids brain. None knows how it works or why it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beliefs are generally your wishes that you think would happen. All wishes won‚Äôt happen, similarly not all beliefs are true.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Listen to everyone, but at the end do whatever you like. After all you are responsible for your own actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge that is not shared with the right audiences is like a rain in the middle of an ocean. It‚Äôs kind of useless.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seeking attention from other people is like seeking attention from a cat. They don‚Äôt give af. Don‚Äôt keep expectations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fire will be seen even in the dark. Truth prevails over lies and falsehood  eventually.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every action there is an equal and  opposite reaction. Which is also called karma. Do good to get good.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dog should control its tail.. not the other way. Make sure only you control your life and not anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>U don‚Äôt have the right to choose ur birth, parents, color or death. But u have all rights to choose ur life. Make it count.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You r lucky to have that one person who loves u &amp; stays with u forever without any blood relation. Love &amp; don‚Äôt loose them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ur enemy will be ur friend in deep forest when you both r alone. Enmity is situational. Don‚Äôt make enemies. Make friends.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is not a race. Don‚Äôt compete, live it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no definition of success. Don‚Äôt just try to be successful, be full in every aspect</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Women are like nature. Both are beautiful/lifegivers. Never disrespect them, they will be a catastrophe &amp; you can‚Äôt survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
